# Monster_Mash
This is a small project to make it easier to homebrew monsters for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. The end goal is to give the choice of either building around a challenge rating (CR) or just creating the monster you want and being given the final challenge rating.

CR table: https://5e.tools/  
Effective spell damage table: u/SuscriptorJusticiero on Reddit

To do:  
- work on adding spellcasting to damage calculations
- finishing working on AC calculation
- factor in dc calcs and prof. ranking
- work out how to use in GUI format (long term goal)
